Apply paw balm to your pup’s paws before and after walks, especially during winter months. Be sure to thoroughly dry their feet prior to application to remove any debris they might have picked up along the way. Always avoid icy surfaces and areas that have recently been salted while on your daily walks and be sure to make ‘paw inspection’ part of your regular routine to help spot any damage or sores early!
